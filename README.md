This Google Compute Engine machine type comparison [webapp](https://gcloud-compute.com/) helps to find the optimal GCE machine type or instance in the many Google Cloud Platform (GCP) regions. A lot of information has been collected from various Google Cloud websites and different sources.

## üñäÔ∏è Add, edit or change machine type information

The Google Compute Engine API is used to get all machine types in all regions and zones.
Additional information is read via SQL files during the build process.
Dive into the [build](./build/) folder to see how the data is retrieved, processed, and integrated.
Feel free to explore and contribute!
