# How to contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding style

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. It is optimized for readability:

* Please also update the documentation.
* Space before the opening curly of a multi-line BLOCK.
* No space before the semicolon.
* Space around most operators.
* No space between function name and its opening parenthesis.
* Line up corresponding things vertically, especially if it'd be too long to fit on one line anyway.
* Please use tabs to indent.
* Be nice.

One more thing:

* Keep it simple! üëç

Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
